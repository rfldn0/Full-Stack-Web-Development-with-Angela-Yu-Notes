# CSS Positioning

  

Define what is static, relative, absolute and fixed positioning. 

  

Static positioning is applied by default. It goes at the bottom of whatever, previous element is. 

  

Continues in the default positioning. 

  

The most common one is Relative positioning. Where it is positioned relative with its default position. 

- It pushes the box 50px from the left to the right and from the top. 
    
- Take a static position and move to the position that is relative to that position. 
    

  

Absolute position is a position relative to nearest positioned ancestor or top left corner of webpage. 

- Move to its nearest ancestors. 
    
- If there were no ancestors, then it would move to the top left of the webpage. 
    
- You have to make sure to set a box to an ancestor of the box you wants to put the box in relations to. Tricky part. 
    

  
  

The z-index

  

- Determines which element goes on top of which in z-axis.

* if a has a higher z-index then a will be shown on top of b.

Fixed positioning is relative to the top-left corner of browser window. Defaulted to the browser. It will be located in the same location on the browser. 

- Perhaps they are used for adds, and top-ups.
